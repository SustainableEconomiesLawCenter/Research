# About this'ere GitHub...

**What I like about GitHub (as opposed to Google Docs) is:**
* We can use "Issues" to have conversations and iron out details. We can tag the issues as "Big Picture Question," "Legal Research," etc.
* We'll have a detailed history of the documents edits, who made what edits, and version control
* When we make changes to documents, there's a way to comment on the nature of those changes, to call attention to what you worked on.
* People can view and comment on the edits
* People can "branch" a document, work on edits in a separate copy, and later merge in the edits
* Once finished, other people will be able to "fork" the documents for their own use
* GitHub is designed for collaborative and open source software design. But I was inspired to use it for legal documents after reading this [article about other ways to use GitHub](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding).

**But there is a bit of a learning curve:**
* You need to take a few minutes to learn Markdown, which is similar to HTML. You can [learn the basics of Markdown here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). You can also paste text from Word into a [converter like this](http://markitdown.medusis.com/) in order to convert it to markdown.
* There are tutorial videos and guides. Even after watching some, I still don't understand all the features.

**Some tips**
* If you create a new file, be sure to add the extension ".md"
* Turns out we can't create footnotes in github, so I suggested that we create footnotes in brackets like this: [1. this is the footnote.] If we put it into wordpress, it'll turn into a footnote and automatically number itself.
